###Code Challenge 6
##Add an append challenge to  LinkedList class that takes a value and adds it at the end of the LinkedList.

##Add an insertBefore method  to  LinkedList class that takes in a value and newValue, and inserts a new Node before the Node that contains the given value.

##Add an insertAfter method to LinkedList class that takes in a value and newValue, and inserts a new Node after the Node that contains the given value.

##Approach and Efficiency
The approach for all these methods involves iterating over the Nodes in the Linked List until reaching the given position where the new Node needs to be inserted. The new Node is then created and inserted into the list by updating other Nodes next value where necessary. .
